# em_examples
This is a repo of notebooks and code used to generate examples for http://em.geosci.xyz. The examples are based on code available in [SimPEG](http://simpeg.xyz). 

If you are working on developing a notebook app, please see [em_examples](http://github.com/geoscixyz/em_examples) and [em_apps](http://github.com/geoscixyz/em_apps)

## Why

As much as possible, we want the figures and results shown in em_geosci to be reproducible, and sometimes you need a workspace to make that happen. This repo is meant to be that workspace, where we can capture work, examples and code. 

## Structure / Organization

Please put code / notebooks in a folder that is the same as the top level chapter of em_geosci.
